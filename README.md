# The-Deep-Double-Ritz-Method

Here, I include a self-developed clean first version of the three deep-learning-based methods (WANs -  Weak Adversarial Networks, GDRM - The Generalised Deep Ritz Method, and D2RM - The Deep Double Ritz Method) discussed in the article "A Deep Double Ritz Method for solving Partial Differential Equations using Neural Networks".

This first version encodes the methods in separate and independent modules (WANs, GDRM, and DDRM). In all the cases, one can easily reproduce the results of the polynomial cases of the article. For the remaining cases, it is necessary to introduce subtleties discussed in the article (such as the midpoint integration rules whose integration mesh is stochastic and oriented to capture the singularities of each case) that, for the moment, I do not include in this first version.

Please, take into consideration that I'm not a developer, and the way I initially produced the results of the article was anything but user-friendly. For the moment, this is all I can offer in a somewhat elegant way. Thank you for being so understanding ;).

If anyone has any particular interest or concern about this work or related topics, please feel free to contact me directly at carlos.uribar@gmail.com.
