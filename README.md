# The-Deep-Double-Ritz-Method
We include a first clean version of the TF2 codes of the three deep-learning-based methods (WANs -  Weak Adversarial Networks, GDRM - The Generalised Deep Ritz Method, and D2RM - The Deep Double Ritz Method) discussed in the article "A Deep Double Ritz Method for solving Partial Differential Equations using Neural Networks"
